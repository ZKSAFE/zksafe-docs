## About ZKSAFE

ZKSAFE is an open source, free, protocol-level security product that uses on-chain password + private key multiple signing to protect assets:
* Private key is hacked, password is safe, and your assets are safe
* Password is cracked, private key is safe, and your assets are safe

`Owner Address` is your wallet address and you can transfer out your safebox assets from this address after depoyed on-chain

>One wallet can only create one safebox, and vice versa
>
>The on-chain password s not the safeboxâ€™s password, but the wallet's. The safebox can be transferred to another wallet through social recovery, to transfer all the assets in the safebox (see Social Recovery for details)

ZKSAFE supports the transfer of NFTï¼ˆERC721ï¼‰besides tokens (ERC20), other asset types (such as ERC1155) are not supported for now
<br>
<br>

### Social Recovery
If you forget the password or private key, you can transfer ownership of the safebox to your other new wallet, so you can use the new wallet's on-chain password + private key to withdraw the assets

<br>

There are 2 ways for transferring the ownership of the safebox:
1. Set multi-signing wallet ahead, which can be your cold wallet or your friendâ€™s wallet, to initiate multi-signing 
2. Use your on-chain password and your private key

The original wallet will be invalid after your transferring the ownership of the safebox to new wallet

>**Reminding**ï¼šZK-SNARK is still need time for testing, and we could exclude the possibility of assets loss caused by password issues, so itâ€™s strongly suggested that each user can set the multi-signing
