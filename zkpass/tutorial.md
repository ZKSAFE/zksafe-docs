## ZKSAFE Password Intro
ZKPass (ZKSAFE Password abbr.ZKPass) has 2 features:
1. Set Password
2. Verify signing

In this case, signing verifying is for another projectâ€™s contract, such as the ZKSAFE contract. Setting passwords is also implemented in the ZKSAFE plugin. To connect with more projects, an ZKPass website was developed where ZKPass is an independent project, so partners can better understand how ZKPass operates at the protocol level rather than relying on the ZKSAFE extension.

The password of ZKPass is the same as ZKSAFE

In short, ZKPass is to B and ZKSAFE is to C

### About Password (Very important)
Here's what you need to know about passwords. Please remember them carefully
* ZKPass does not store your password, and no one knows your password except yourself
* ZKPass has no administrator, no one can help you retrieve or reset your password 
* Don't forget your password. Don't save in computer or phone. Write it down on paper


There's nothing we can do to stop the password-cracking, about the password strength
* 6 characters can be cracked in 10 days, don't make it that short
* 8 characters may take only months in the future as computer performance improves;
* 12 characters are recommended, which can be a short sentence + a number, such as *2022IHaveADreamToday*
